# Augmented Reality - Homework #3

**Course:** CSE462/562 â€“ Augmented Reality (Fall 2024)  

## Description
This project focuses on solving two problems related to homography matrix calculations and 3D object placement in an augmented reality environment.

## Problem 1: Homography Matrix Calculation
### Tasks:
1. **Calculate Homography Matrix:**
   - Implemented a C# function to compute the homography matrix using point correspondences.
2. **Handle Unmatched Points:**
   - Implemented a C# function that computes the homography matrix using a matching confidence matrix.
3. **Scene to Image Projection:**
   - Function to project scene points onto an image using a homography matrix.
4. **Image to Scene Projection:**
   - Function to project image points onto the scene using a homography matrix.
5. **Point Correspondence:**
   - Manually identified five-point correspondences for three images and computed homography matrices.
   - Calculated projection errors for three additional points.
6. **Projection Calculations:**
   - Computed projections of specific scene points onto images.
   - Computed projections of specific image points onto the scene.

## Problem 2: Teapot Placement in AR
### Tasks:
1. **3D Placement:**
   - Positioned a teapot with a square bounding box (15 cm) on the white object at the end of the cables in 19 images.
   - Used USB connectors for accurate dimension references.
2. **Projection Logic:**
   - Developed a programmatic solution to project the teapot onto all images.
